      "question": "What is happening?",
      "answer": "These are results from a ranked choice election with 2 winners. Voters were asked to rank the candidates from most to least favorite. The ballots are then counted in rounds. In each round, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their supporters' votes transfer to the next choice on their ballots. The rounds continue until 2 candidates have been elected by each earning more than 33.5% of the votes."

    {
      "question": "What are Inactive Ballots?",
      "answer": "A ballot is \"inactive\" if the voter did not rank any of the candidates remaining in that round. Voters are not required to rank all the candidates, so if all the candidates they ranked are eliminated, their ballot becomes inactive."

      "question": "Why was Harvey Curley elected?",
      "answer": "In a ranked choice election with 1, each candidate needs to earn more than 33.5% of the votes to win a seat. 33.5% is the threshold for victory because only 1 candidates can earn more than 33.5% of the votes."

      "question": "Why did they need 134 votes to win?",
      "answer": "In a single-winner election, the winning candidate needs to earn the support of at least 1 in 2 voters. Since each voter only gets one vote, the same requirement is not possible for this Single Transferable Vote election. Instead, each winning candidate must earn the support of 1 in 3 voters."
