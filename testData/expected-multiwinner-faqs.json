      "question": "What is happening?",
      "answer": "This is a proportional Ranked Choice Voting election which elects multiple winners. There were 2 seats to be filled. Voters have ranked their candidates in order of preference. Each voter still only had one vote. The lowest-performing candidates were eliminated until 2 candidates have been elected."

    {
      "question": "What are Inactive Ballots?",
      "answer": "Voters are not required to rank all candidates. In this round, all ballots are still active, meaning that no ballot had all of their choices eliminated already."

      "question": "Why was Write-In eliminated?",
      "answer": "Because they had the fewest votes and could not win the election, they were eliminated. To ensure people who voted for them still had their voices heard, their votes were transferred to their next choice. If you are familiar with the concept of runoff elections, you can think of these eliminations as holding a runoff without going back to the voting booth."

      "question": "Why was Harvey Curley elected?",
      "answer": "Because Harvey Curley received 134 votes, they were elected. The threshold of 134 votes was chosen to achieve proportional representation, equal to at least one out of every 3 voters supporting this candidate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did they need 134 votes to win?",
      "answer": "In a single-winner election, the winning candidate needs to earn the support of at least 1 in 2 voters. Since each voter only gets one vote, the same requirement is not possible for this Single Transferable Vote election. Instead, each winning candidate must earn the support of 1 in 3 voters."

      "question": "Why did Harvey Curley lose 10 votes?",
      "answer": "A principle of RCV is that no vote should be wasted. Since Harvey Curley only needed 134 votes, any vote beyond that should not be wasted, and is instead redistributed. This also ensures that 2 candidates can reach the 134-vote threshold. The 10 votes were are redistributed to remaining candidates proportionally based on voters' next choices."
